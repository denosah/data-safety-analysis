the project is to analyze aviation accidents data inorder to provide  actionable insights to stakeholders. 
 Key questions asked are flight phases prone to accidents, weather conditions impact to accident severity and counts and rate of accidents occurence per year
 data anaysis and understanding: columns used are weather conditions, broad.phase.of.flight, total.fatal.injuries and publication date. we also cleaned data by handling missing values 
 visualization include: trends of accidents over time,flights reportedly having accidents, counts of accidents caused by weather conditions and counts of injuries caused by weather conditions
 key findings: takoff is the riskiest phase and weather conditions taken on visual perspective corollates with higher accidents
 recommendation:priotize pilot training and improve data collection for minor injuries to improve data completness
